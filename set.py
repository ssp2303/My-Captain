# Program to perform different set operations like in mathematics

# Define three sets
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Set Union
print("Union of E and N is",E | N)

# Set Intersection
print("Intersection of E and N is",E & N)

# Set Difference
print("Difference of E and N is",E - N)

# Set Symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of E and N is",E ^ N)
